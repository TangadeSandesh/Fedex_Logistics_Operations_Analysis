# 📦 FedEx Logistics Opertions Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of FedEx logistics and operations data to find patterns, trends, and inefficiencies in shipment performance.  
The analysis aims to help understand delivery timelines, shipment behavior, and operational bottlenecks using data-driven insights.

The project is implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**, leveraging popular data analysis and visualization libraries.
